  Hi, I'm James Farrelly—a tech executive, hockey guy, and set-building dad.
  <p></p>
  I’ve spent over two decades at Pfizer, growing from a developer to my current role
  as Vice President of Solution Delivery. Today, I lead global teams building the
  digital platforms that power Pfizer's R&D engine. We create AI-driven automation,
  build patient and site facing clinical trial systems, and deploy cloud-native tools
  that help our science move faster. My focus is on solving complex challenges with
  technology and empowering the scientific breakthroughs that change patient lives.
  <p></p>
  My leadership style is high-energy and people-first. I believe in meeting people
  where they are, finding their strengths, and building high-trust, high-performance
  teams. I try to find great people to work with, then empower them to build amazing
  and beautiful technology experiences.
  <p></p>
  Outside of work, you’ll find me on the ice or backstage. I skate with the Mahogany
  Woodsmen, a men's league team that serves as my outlet for competition and lots
  of laughing and nonsense.
  <p></p>
  I also design and build sets for the Lionville Middle School theater program. My
  wife is the costumer, and together we love helping the students create the same
  kind of lasting memories we remember from our own high school theater days.
  <p></p>
  Whether it's tech, teamwork, or theater, it all comes down to one simple mantra:
  Always be useful. If I can help someone solve a problem, build something great,
  or just make their day a little easier, that's a win.
  <p></p>
